Unit test generator proof of concept (intended to be used in Exercism)

organization
============

- `unittests.py` : the code that does the work of actually generating test suites
- `*.json` : files describing individual exercism problems along with inputs and expected outputs
- `testify.sh` : run this to generate unit tests for all current problems in all current languages
- `generated` : this directory is where autogenerated unit tests end up
